//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// Defined by AppleSMC.kext
///
/// This is the predefined struct that must be passed to communicate with the
/// AppleSMC driver. While the driver is closed source, the definition of this
/// struct happened to appear in the Apple PowerManagement project at around
/// version 211, and soon after disappeared. It can be seen in the PrivateLib.c
/// file under pmconfigd. Given that it is C code, this is the closest
/// translation to Swift from a type perspective.
///
/// ### Issues
///
/// * Padding for struct alignment when passed over to C side
/// * Size of struct must be 80 bytes
/// * C array's are bridged as tuples
///
